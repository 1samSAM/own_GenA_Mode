# Build Your Own Generative AI Model  

Welcome to the repository for building your own Generative AI model as part of the **NxtWave Hands-On Workshop**. This project provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tune a base model using Dreambooth, train it for a specific task, and deploy it on Hugging Face for testing and sharing.  

---

## üöÄ Overview  

This hands-on project introduces you to generative AI techniques, including:  
- Installing dependencies.  
- Downloading a pre-trained base model.  
- Setting up Dreambooth for fine-tuning.  
- Training and validating your model.  
- Deploying the trained model on Hugging Face.

## üìÇ Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dependencies Installation  
Install essential libraries and tools such as:  
- `transformers`, `diffusers`, `torch`, and other Python-based frameworks.  
- Use the provided Google Colab notebook to automate the installation process.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Base Model Download  
Retrieve a pre-trained base model from Hugging Face. This model serves as the foundation for your custom fine-tuning tasks.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dreambooth Fine-Tuning Setup  
Prepare the model for fine-tuning:  
- Upload your dataset to the Colab environment.  
- Configure training parameters like learning rate and batch size.  
- Set up Dreambooth for personalized fine-tuning.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Training  
Train the model on your dataset using transfer learning. Monitor the process to ensure the model adapts well to the new task.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your Model  
Validate the performance of your trained model by running inference scripts. Use sample inputs to generate and assess outputs.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Upload to Hugging Face  
Publish your trained model on Hugging Face. This step makes your model accessible for further use or sharing with others.
